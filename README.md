Sorting algorithm with typescript
this project was for learning purpose on how to interface ,abstract ,inheritence to have some really reusable code.

First i implemented the sorting algorith using interface and class to have some resusable code 
Then refactor the code using  abstract class and inheritence to also get some resusable

Lesson learnt during the project :

Interfaces:

-sets up contract between different classes
-Use when we have different objects that want to work together.
-promotes loose coupling 


Inheritence/Abstract classes:

-Sets up contract between different classes
-Use when we are trying to build up a definition of an object 
-Strongly couples classes together
